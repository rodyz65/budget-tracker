#Budget Tracker Project
This project has two versions of a budget tracker:

1. **Command-Line Version ('main.py')** 

The main.py is a command line version that asks the user to input information like the name of the transaction and the amount associated with it.
2. **GUI Version ('budget_tracker_gui.ipynb')** 

The jupyter notebook contains a GUI version of the budget tracker made using Tkinter. It uses JSON to save and load transactions so the user's progress is saved. This version allows the user to remove transactions, add transactions, and also displays a running balance.

## How to Run

**Command-Line Version ('main.py')** 
Type into the terminal "python main.py"

**GUI Version ('budget_tracker_gui.ipynb')** 
Open the budget_tracker_gui.ipynb and run all the cells.

Data Storage
Each version has its own JSON file to save transaction data.
